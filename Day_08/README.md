100-Days_Of_Code

DAY_08

OBJECTIVE OF THE DAY - Build a ceaser cypher program

By the end of the day I'd have learned all about functions with inputs
arguments and parameters.
	. The difference between argument and parameters

And at the end of the day, I combined all of the concepts I've learned
together to build a ceaser cypher program.



NEW THIGS LEARNED

	. Difference between function Parameter and Argument:
	  A Function parameter is the name (identifier) given to the
	  variable that's in the function definition, why the argument
	  is the actual value of the data being passed.



EXERCISES

i. Life In Weeks:
 - Write a program that calculates how many weeks you have left to live
   assuming you'll live only 90 years. Weeks should should be calculated
   based on user's aged passed as argument to the function that calculates
   the age.
	PSEUDOCODE:
		. Create a file 'life_in_weeks.py'
		. begin file with '#!/usr/bin/python3'
		. create a function 'life_in_weeks' function has one
		  parameter 'age'
		. create a variable weeks_in_a_year = 365 // 7
		. creata another variable max_age = 90
		. create another variable weeks_left = (max_age - age) *
							weeks_in_a_year
		. print value of variable 'weeks_left'
