100-Days_Of_Code

DAY_06 - Functions, Code Blocks and While loops


OBJECTIVE:
 Learn all about functions, code blocks, while loops and the relationship between
 while loop and if-elif-else statement block

 - Functions:
 	A function in programming is a block of code that performs a specific set
	of task.

 - While loop:
 	A while loop in python is a mechanism used for executing a block of code,
	repeatedly until the condition for its execution becomes false.


EXERCISES:

All the exercise for this project are written on reboorg's world. The aim is to
write while loops, functions and if-elif-else statement while playing a game. Use
the code to help our friend reboorg the robot to overcome obstacles by giving it
specific instructions.



PROJECT OF THE DAY:

The main project of the day was to write a program in reboorg world app, to help
our robotic friend reboorg navigate out of a dark maze, his torch and lights are
all down, we have to write code that'll help guide reboorg out of the maze.

Check out the link to reboorg world for a chance to help our little friend reboorg.
